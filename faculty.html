            3D printing is an educational technology that is valuable across multiple disciplines. The Rebecca Crown Library staff is
            here to assist faculty with incorporating 3D printing into their courses. A librarian can work with you to create
            an assignment or simply provide you students with an instruction session in the 3D lab.
