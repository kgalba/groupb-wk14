  <h3><a id="1">What is 3D printing?</a></h3>
  <p>3D printing refers to rapid prototyping - creating a physical 3-dimensional object from a digital model. There are several types of 3D printers. The Rebecca Crown Library has a <a href="http://www.flashforge-usa.com/creator-pro/" target="_blank">FLASHFORGE Creator PRO Dual Extrusion 3D Printer</a> which performs a Fused Filament Fabrication - FFF technique (also known as Fused Deposition Modeling - FDM) to create the final 3D printed object. In this method, a lightweight plastic filament is fed through the nozzle, heated up to its melting point and then extruded onto a build plate surface, hardening upon impact. This process continues depositing the melted filament layer by layer until a 3-dimensional object is formed.</p>
  <h3><a id="2">What are practical uses for 3D Printing?</a></h3>
  <p>Here are some examples of practice and use in an educational environment:<br>
      Architecture - printing their 3D models to further enhance their understanding of structures<br>
      Fine Arts - creating 3D objects from their digital designs; incorporating 3D prints into their other media; designing and 3D printing jewelry, fabric, sculptures, etc.<br>
      Visual Communication Design - creating prototypes of product designs and packaging<br>
      3D Animation - creating 3D printed objects from their designs either to create a stop motion film or a 3D character reference<br>
      Engineering - creating 3D prototypes of their designs in order to fully understand their engineering design principles and to experience the challenges that are encountered along the way<br>
      Advertising / Marketing / Business / Entrepreneurs - having a 3D prototype of the item that they are selling and to show their clients<br>
      Nursing / Medicine - creating 3D replicas of anatomy or creating personalized prosthetics<br>
      Archeology / Paleontology - creating 3D replicas of fragile relics for study (ex. creating replicas of fossils in order to study their movement, etc.)<br>
      Forensics - incorporating 3D printing into crime scene investigation (ex. creating 3D replicas of evidence, such as footprints, or skeletal remains and facial reconstruction)<br>
      Chemistry / Physics / Biology - creating accurate 3D visual aids such as DNA or chemical reactions<br>
      Any discipline can see the benefit of using the 3D printer to add to the learning experience</p>
  <h3><a id="3">Who can use the printer?</a></h3>
  <p>The printer is available for use by current Dominican University students, staff and faculty in any discipline.</p>
  <h3><a id="4">When is the printer available for use?</a></h3>
  <p>The printer is available for use during regularly scheduled Media Center hours when a trained staff member is present.</p>
  <h3><a id="5">How much does it cost?</a></h3>
  <p>The 3D printing is currently free for students. For Faculty and Staff, there may be a cost to the items requested for 3D printing depending on how much filament was used. To help offset the effects of using plastic for 3D printing, we ask that users bring in five items for recycling. (Plastic Bottles, Aluminum Cans, Magazines, Etc.)</p>
  <h3><a id="6">How large of an object can I print?</a></h3>
  <p>Objects must not exceed 9 inches across, 6 inches deep, and 5.7 inches tall. Printing time for an object should not exceed 6 hours. Please be aware that we may ask to print your model at a scale smaller than your original design. We do this with the goal of ensuring the best success of your print. With some ingenuity, though, you can print larger objects simply by separating your model into smaller and easier to print pieces. So keep that in mind as you prepare your file for printing.</p>
  <h3><a id="7">How many objects can I print?</a></h3>
  <p>There is no limit to the number of objects a student can print during their time at Dominican since the service is free. We do however limit the number of files a student can send at one time to 7. If you need more than 7 different files printed at one time, email us or stop by the Media Center and arrangements can be made. </p>
  <h3><a id="8">What can or cannot be printed?</a></h3>
  <p>Printed objects should be for class use or as part of a Dominican University-sponsored event. Library staff retains the right to refuse any print request for any reason. </p>
  <h3><a id="9">Which 3D modeling software should I use to create a printable design?</a></h3>
  <p>The printer only accepts files formats .STL and .OBJ.  As long as the software exports your file in one of those two formats we should be able to print your object. You can use any software you like to design your model so choose software that works best for you. The software we are familiar with and have loaded in the Media Center are Tinkercad and Blender. Visit the Software and 3D Models tab for some of our software recommendations or visit either 3D printing for beginners and Shapeway for some more excellent recommendations.</p>
  <h3><a id="10">Which file formats do you accept?</a></h3>
  <p>The printer accepts .STL and .OBJ files. Most 3D modeling programs can save and export at least one of those two formats. </p>
  <h3><a id="11">What kind of filament is used?</a></h3>
  <p>Both ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) and PLA (Polylactic Acid) can be used on the FLASHFORGE Creator PRO Dual Extrusion 3D Printer. You may also purchase your own filament if you need a color we do not currently have.  Before purchasing filament, email us or stop by the Media Center to get the specifications for filament and recommended purchase sites.</p>
  <h3><a id="12">How many colors can my object be printed in?</a></h3>
  <p>The Dual Extrusion feature of the printer allows for printing with two different color filaments to create a single object.<br>
    Objects printed in two colors require two different .STL files.  Click on (Video) Introduction to dual extrusion on the Makerbot Replicator 2x or visit the Tips and Tutorials tab to learn how to prepare your 2-color model for 3D printing. Although the video uses 123Design software, any software will work as long as you save the two parts as two different .STL files. We recommended that when you save each .STL file to include left and right or the filament color you would like each file to be printed. This simple step will help ensure the success of your print, since the software we currently use does not allow us to see what the combined object will look like. If you need help preparing your model stop by the Media Center or email us.<br>
    Please note that Dual Extrusion will not make printing any faster since only one color is printed at a time.</p>
